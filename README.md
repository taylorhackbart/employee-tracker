## Technologies Used
Nodejs, mySQL, mySQL Workbench, console.table, util, and inquirer

## Problems I faced
While the overall assignment was not difficult, referencing the class file and creating proper SELECT and JOIN statements was tricky. 

## Credits
Joey and I worked on this together to come up with our functions, and my tutor! Tyler is great, and as always, I had help from the rest of my classmates.
